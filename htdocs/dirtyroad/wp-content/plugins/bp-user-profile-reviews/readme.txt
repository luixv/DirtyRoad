== Description ==

This plugin  allows only site members to add reviews to the buddypress members on the site. But the member can not review itself. And if the visitor is not logged in, he can only see the listing of the reviews but can not review.  The review form allows the members to even rate the member's profile out of 5 points with multiple review criteria.

You can add multiple criteria for review. And you can change the positions of those Criteria.  Review form shows on the member's profile but you can show review form on another page just by shortcode. BP member profile review plugin adds a widget for display top reviewed member listing .

It is built to be reliable, scalable, secure and flexible. We have worked hard to make it easy to use and we will love your feedback in making it better.
